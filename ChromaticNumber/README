Jeremy Gousse Azzimov Test - Chromatic Graphs

INSTALLATION
  run 'make' to compile

RUN
  run './ChromaticNumber TARGET_FILE' to launch the program, where TARGET_FILE is a file path to a file located under the graphs directory.
  example: ./ChromaticNumber graphs/1

OUTPUT
  At the end of the process, the program outputs two different thing:
  1: a representation of the graph it loaded (initially done to verify the correct load of the graph).
  2: the number of unique colors in that graph.

SRC
  There are three source files: main.cpp graph.hpp graph.cpp

PROJECT
  The project uses c++ 11, git, cmake and gcc (it appears clang is not installed on the machine)
